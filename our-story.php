              <p>For Rahul, the journey towards the love of food began from a small kitchen in Varanasi. He loves to explore in his food and respects the process which goes into it, as for him, the means is equally important as the end. His
              signature ‘Yellow Dal’ is mouthwatering yummilicious making everyone wonder how something as simple and plain as a Dal could taste so
              phenomenal. It is a new found interest in spirits for him & he is still learning the craft. His understanding of the method which goes behind a person’s choice of drink makes him a go to host. It is this intricate love for cuisines & his inter-personal understanding that made Rahul quit a successful career in Media Advertising and venture out in viand and spirits. He draws support
              & inspiration from his better half – Nidhi Rastogi.</p>
